- File system structure
   |
   +-- README (file, optional)
   |     This file, just for information.
   |
   +-- crl-<digital id 1> (e.g. crl-1, folder)
   |   |
   |   +-- UPDATEME (file, optional)
   |   |     If present, it indicates that content of this folder is changed.
   |   |
   |   +-- ca.crt (file, required)
   |   |     CA certificate. Either DER or PEM encoded.
   |   |
   |   +-- crl.url (file, optional)
   |   |     If present, contains a line of the URL to download the CRL.
   |   |
   |   +-- REVOCATION (file, optional)
   |   |     If present, it specifies the revocation information of the CA.
   |   |     An example file is the folder template.
   |   |     If there are multiple CRLs for the same CA certificate, only one of
   |   |     the REVOCATION file of revoked CA certificate will be considered.
   |   |
   |   +-- issuer.crt (file, required for indirect CRL)
   |   |     If present, it specifies the CRL issuer certificate.
   |   |
   |   +-- <name>.crl (file, optional)
   |   |     The CRL itself. DER encoded.
   |   |     If the CA is not revoked, exact one CRL file is allowed, otherwise,
   |   |     no CRL is allowed.
   |   |
   |   +-- certs (directory, optional)
   |         Contains all certificates that are valid at current time
   |         (notBefore <= current <= notAfter).
   |         Either the DER or PEM encoded raw certificate in a file with
   |         suffix crt, der or pem, or the heximal serial numbers in the
   |         file with suffix serials. Each crt-file contains exact one
   |         certificate, and each serials-file contains multiple serial
   |         numbers, one per line.
   |
   +-- crl-<digital id n> (e.g. crl-2, folder)
             Same layout as the directory crl-<digital id 1>
